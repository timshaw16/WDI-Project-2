# Intro
This is my secdon project at GA on the WDI course. The task was to build a built-page app using authentication with a bonus of adding an API.

# About SnowFo
SnowFo list's the best ski resorts that I have skied in Europe and Canada. I have also added an 'Add' feature where users can add their own resorts where they have skied.

# Planning & Design

I first started my planning and design using Balsamiq. This is the first time I have used this feature and enjoyed using this to plan my site. 

I also used Trello for the first time.

# Building
This project was completly different to my first one as I didn't have much help with the planning or building only with the API. I did use the walkthrough's we were provided but understood what I needed to do and what the code was doing. I started with the JavaScrip files and then completed the EJS files. I finished off with the style which I used vanilla CSS.

# Challenges
Knowing where to start with the API. Also was stuck adding the video to the front page.

# Success
I had little help throughout this project with the main coding and styling. The only help I had was with the API and how to style the countries page.  

# Further Expansion
I would like to have it mobile responsive
On my next project I will try and use a styling framework. On this project I used vanilla styling and it's a but chunky.
